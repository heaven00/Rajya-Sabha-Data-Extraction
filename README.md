# Rajya Sabha Data Extraction 

With the whole lot of misinformation and misguided stats that are becoming part of our daily life I want to create a source of data
that might tell me more about what is really happening in the country. So this project is a naive attempt to make the Rajya Sabha debates 
data more accessible for people to consume.

# The data
Currently the debates from Rajya sabha are published in PDF format on their website.

- Verbatim archives, i.e. debates by time and day `http://164.100.47.5/newsite/debatenew/newshow.aspx?arch=245` This includes the un edited debates noted down during the conduct by hours of the days
- Date Wise Full day edited debates `http://164.100.47.5/newsite/floor_official_debate/floor_official_debate.aspx`
